# Property Booking System

This document outlines the data model for a property booking platform, including entity definitions, their attributes, relationships, and how they work together to support core platform functionality like listing properties, making bookings, handling payments, and submitting reviews.

# Purpose

The goal of this system is to allow users (guests and hosts) to interact through a platform where:
- Hosts can list properties.
- Guests can search for, book, and review properties.
- Payments are processed and tied to **bookings.
- Ratings and feedback are managed via reviews.
